					 GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS

AIM:

	To write a python program to read three numbers and print the greatest of three numbers.

ALGORITHM:

	1.Start the program.
	2.Read the first number.
	3.Read the second number.
	4.Read the third number.
	5.Compare first and second numbers.
	6.Compare the largest with the third number.
	7.Check if first number is the greatest.
	8.If true, assign it to big.
	9.Else check if second number is the greatest.
	10.Assign the greatest value to big.
	11.Print the greatest number.
	12.Stop the program.

PROGRAM:

n1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
n2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
n3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))
if n1 >= n2 and n1 >= n3:
    big = n1
elif n2 >= n1 and n2 >= n3:
    big = n2
else:
    big = n3
print("The greatest of the three numbers is:", big)

RESULT:

	Thus, the Python program to find the greatest of three numbers was executed successfully and the output was obtained.
